    <h3><b><i>Three-Part Invention</i></b></h3>
    <p>Bach wrote fifteen three-part inventions. In this three-part Dialogue, the Tortoise and Achilles -the main fictional progtagonists in the Dialogues- are "invented" by Zeno (as in fact they were, to illustrate Zeno's paradoxes of motion). Very short, it simply gives the flavor of the Dialogues to come.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><i>Achilles (a Greek warrior, the fleetest of foot of all mortals) and a Tortoise are standing together on a dusty runway in the hot sun. Far down the runway, on a tall flagpole, there hangs a large rectangular flag. The flag is solid red, except where a thin ring-shaped hole has been cut out of it, through which one can see the sky.</i></p>
